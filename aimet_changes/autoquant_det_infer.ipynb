    "# AutoQuant\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET AutoQuant feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "AIMET offers a suite of neural network post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques that can be applied in succession. However, the process of finding the right combination and sequence of techniques to apply is time-consuming and requires careful analysis, which can be challenging especially for non-expert users. We instead recommend AutoQuant to save time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoQuant is an API that applies various PTQ techniques in AIMET automatically based on analyzing the model and best-known heuristics. In AutoQuant, users specify the amount of tolerable accuracy drop, and AutoQuant will apply PTQ techniques cumulatively until the target accuracy is satisfied.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Overall flow\n",
    "This notebook covers the following\n",
    "1. Define constants and helper functions\n",
    "2. Load a pretrained FP32 model\n",
    "3. Run AutoQuant\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What this notebook is not\n",
    "This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art AutoQuant results. For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet18. Also, some optimization parameters are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly.\n"

    "**Note2**: To speed up the execution of this notebook, you may use a reduced subset of the ImageNet dataset. E.g. the entire ILSVRC2012 dataset has 1000 classes, 1000 training samples per class and 50 validation samples per class. But for the purpose of running this notebook, you could perhaps reduce the dataset to say 2 samples per class. This exercise is left upto the reader and is not necessary.\n",
