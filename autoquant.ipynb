        "This notebook shows a working code example of how to use AIMET AutoQuant feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "AIMET offers a suite of neural network post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques that can be applied in succession. However, the process of finding the right combination and sequence of techniques to apply is time-consuming and requires careful analysis, which can be challenging especially for non-expert users. We instead recommend AutoQuant to save time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoQuant is an API that applies various PTQ techniques in AIMET automatically based on analyzing the model and best-known heuristics. In AutoQuant, users specify the amount of tolerable accuracy drop, and AutoQuant will apply PTQ techniques cumulatively until the target accuracy is satisfied.\n",

        "3. Run AutoQuant\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What this notebook is not\n",
        "This notebook is not designed to show state-of-the-art AutoQuant results. For example, it uses a relatively quantization-friendly model like Resnet18. Also, some optimization parameters are deliberately chosen to have the notebook execute more quickly.\n"
